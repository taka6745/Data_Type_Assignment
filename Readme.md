# CAB301 ALGORITHMS AND COMPLEXITY - Assignment 3

**Due Date:** 2 June 2023  
**Weighting:** 40%  
**Group or Individual:** Individual

## Introduction
This assignment focuses on applying your knowledge of data structures and algorithms to develop a real-world software project management system. You will be required to identify significant Abstract Data Types (ADTs) in the application, design and implement these ADTs, and use them to build the project management system. Additionally, you will need to apply algorithms to solve computational problems arising from the ADT implementations and application building.

## Task Summary
1. Information and Software Requirements
   - Develop a project management system to manage a list of tasks in a project.
   - Tasks may have dependencies on other tasks.
   - Task information, including task ID, time needed to complete the task, and task dependencies, is stored in a text file.
2. Microsoft Console Application
   - Create a command-line menu for the project management system.
   - Allow the user to:
     - Enter the name of a text file and read task information from it.
     - Add a new task with its dependencies to the project.
     - Remove a task from the project.
     - Change the completion time of a task.
     - Save the updated task information back to the input text file.
     - Find a sequence of tasks that satisfies all dependencies and save it to a text file.
     - Find the earliest possible commencement time for each task and save the solution to a text file.
3. Assignment Requirements
   - Use C# as the programming language.
   - Create a console application using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 (Community Edition).

## Submission Guidelines
- Create a single zip file named `your-student-number.zip` containing your entire console application project.
- Do not submit any other documents.
- The submitted archive must be in standard .zip format. Other formats like .7z, .rar, .gz, etc., will not be accepted.
- Submit your assignment through the CAB301 Canvas website. Email submissions are not accepted.
- You can submit your assignment multiple times before the deadline.
